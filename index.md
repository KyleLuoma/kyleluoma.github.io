## About Me

![Profile Picture](/assets/img/profile.jpg?s=80)

##### I am a PhD Student at the University of California - San Diego (UCSD). I am a member of Professor Arun Kumar's Database Lab (ADALab). I am also a member of the U.S. Army, and am pursuing my PhD prior to my assignment to the Army Cyber Institute at West Point. My research interests revolve around the intersection of data science and data engineering. I am also interested in languages and the interaction between humans and machines. I will be working with members of the ADALab on projects such as SpeakQL.
